# The app-build job's symlink guard for tenant CI (the step "Reject a symlink
# that escapes the repository", which runs it from its mirror checkout): it
# refuses any symlink in the checkout whose target resolves outside the
# repository checkout ($GITHUB_WORKSPACE), and any dangling one, walking the
# whole checkout from the step's working directory, node_modules included,
# and pruning .git and the mirror checkout (public platform code). The
# step's comment in platform-ci.yml says why, and what it does not contain.
#
# Each refused link is one annotation from ci/annotate.mjs beside this
# script, the link as its file, so a link's name, which the author (or a
# dependency's tarball) chose, reaches the log only through logSafe. GitHub
# keeps ten annotations of a kind a step, so links past the tenth are named in
# one plain line instead, each name through the same logSafe (build decision
# 14). A name can start with "-" (a link at the checkout root reaches each
# command bare), so realpath takes it after --, every helper argument is
# --opt=value, and the plain line's names follow the helper's path after --
# (build decision 16). (The step's inline body until v0.18.16, CI-02.)
#
# Usage: ci/symlink-guard.sh, from the checkout root, with GITHUB_WORKSPACE
# set.
