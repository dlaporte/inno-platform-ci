// helper — can import it standalone.
// The other ci/ helpers every script may need live here too, among them the
// reader of the instance's names (loadInstanceData), so the mirror ships no
// extra file for them.

// Fixed here, twice. The old broker-post.mjs version compared
// `importMetaUrl === \`file://${process.argv[1]}\``, a hand-built template
// that breaks for any argv[1] path needing percent-encoding (spaces, etc.):
// file URLs percent-encode such characters, so the template never matched
// and the CLI block silently did nothing. The pathToFileURL(argv[1]) form
// that replaced it missed every symlinked path (isMainModule says why). Both
// sides are now compared as real file paths, and fileURLToPath undoes
// exactly the encoding Node's own import.meta.url applies.

 * to the same behaviour. The length bound is this side's own addition,
 * because every caller here is writing exactly one log line, whereas src/
 * leaves the bound to each caller.
 *
 * The character class is written as ESCAPES, never as raw bytes: an editing
 * tool flattened this exact class into literal control bytes on 2026-09-18,
 * where it stayed invisible to tsc and to the whole suite. A scan of the
 * committed bytes is the only instrument that finds that, and
