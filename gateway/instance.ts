// naming.groupPrefix), so they sit beside the code that reads them and come
// from the same gateway.ref; another instance's mirror needs no code change.

// The twin of src/instance.ts's prefix reads (gateway/ builds separately and
// imports nothing from src/). test/instance-formula-parity.node.test.ts holds
// the rule below to the Worker's and to tenant CI's, verdict for verdict,
// and every formula built from these two to its src/naming.ts builder.
